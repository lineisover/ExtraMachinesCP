  Extra Machines is an addon asset-pack that adds new cars to the original Hard Truck. The main version of the mod is adapted for a normal play, the most suitable for the player cars can be purchased in cities, and the rest can be obtained only with cheats (/car(26) - /car(42)).
  All cars in the pack were created specifically for Hard Truck, and are not ports from other games, as in many other mods. The mod is unprecedented in the level of quality of the added cars, the variety of available cabins and bodies, the presence of damage models for all playable cars, in fact, perfectly fitting into the game on a par with the original cars made by Targem Games.

      Pleb - Basic Cabin for Redneck. They say it can be pierced with spit.

      Country - Artisanal modification of the basic cabin, most likely made by a fellow mechanic over a cup of something strong.
      Urbana - Redneck Native Body. Be sure to lock the back door or they'll steal what's inside.

      Palatium - The best body for the Redneck. It doesn't have much space, alas, but this is more than compensated for by its armour.
